# Slurm Docker Cluster

This is a multi-container Slurm cluster using docker-compose.  The compose file
creates named volumes for persistent storage of MySQL data files as well as
Slurm state and log directories.

## Containers and Volumes

The compose file will run the following containers:

* mysql
* slurmdbd
* slurmctld
* login01 
* node01
* node02

The compose file will create the following named volumes:

* etc_munge         ( -> /etc/munge     )
* etc_slurm         ( -> /etc/slurm     )
* slurm_jobdir      ( -> /data          )
* var_lib_mysql     ( -> /var/lib/mysql )
* var_log_slurm     ( -> /var/log/slurm )


## Using Slurm

Use `docker exec` to run a shell on the login node container.

```sh
docker exec -it login01 bash
```
Or run one command at a time.
```sh
docker exec login01 sacct
```
